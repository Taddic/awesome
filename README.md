My AwesomeWM config

Requirements: Awesome 4.2. Not guaranteed to work with previous versions.

Uses files from:
https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widgets
https://github.com/pltanton/net_widgets

Includes config for
* General Awesome WM config I prefer
* Battery widget
* Spotify widget
* Spotify multimedia buttons shortcuts
* Volume widget
* Volume keyboard shortcuts

The configuration is sorted into different files for clarity, and also includes
a "local customization" section which allows me to have most of the config up
on github and add config that differ for work, home desktop and/or laptop.
