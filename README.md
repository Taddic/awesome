My AwesomeWM config

## Requirements
* Awesome 4.2. Not guaranteed to work with previous versions.

## Uses files from:
* https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widgets
* https://github.com/pltanton/net_widgets

## Included config
* General Awesome WM config I prefer
* Wallpaper located in wallpaper/background.png (takes effect when this directory and file is created)
* Battery widget
* Spotify widget
* Spotify multimedia buttons shortcuts
* Volume widget
* Volume keyboard shortcuts

The configuration is sorted into different files for clarity, and also includes
a "local customization" section which allows me to have most of the config up
on github and add config that differ for work, home desktop and/or laptop.

## Desktop file
There is a desktop file awesome.desktop included as well, this is mostly for reference if the file is needed for some reaseon.
The location of the file is supposed to be in:
/usr/share/xsessions/awesome.desktop
